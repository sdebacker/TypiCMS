## Modules

### Pages

Pages are nestable with drag and drop, on drop, URIs are generated and saved in the database. A page has routes for each translation.

### Menus

Each menu has nestable entries. One entry can be linked to a module, page, URI or URL.
You can get a HTML formated menu with ``` Menus::build('menuname') ```.
An icon can easily be added to a menu item by filling the icon class field.

### Projects

Projects have categories, projects URLs follows this pattern: /en/projects/category-slug/project-slug

### Categories

Categories have many projects.

### Tags

Tags are linked to projects and use the [Selectize](https://brianreavis.github.io/selectize.js/) jQuery plugin.
The tags moudle has many to many polymorphic relations so it could easily be linked to other modules.

### Events

Events have starting and ending dates.

### News

Simple news module with linked files/images galleries.

### Contacts

Frontend contact form and admin side records management.

### Partners

A partner has a logo, website URL, title and body content.

### Files

The files module allows you to upload multiple files. It uses [DropzoneJS](http://www.dropzonejs.com) to upload them.
Thumbnails are generated on the fly with [Croppa](https://github.com/BKWLD/croppa).

### Galleries

You can create as many galleries as you want, each gallery has many files.
Galleries are linkable to any module item through a polymorphic many to many relation, for now only the news module is properly set up to support galleries.

### Users and groups

[Sentry 2](https://cartalyst.com/manual/sentry) is used to manage users, groups and permissions.
User registration can be enabled through the settings panel (/admin/settings).

### Blocks

Blocks are useful to display custom content in your views.
You can get the content of a block with ``` Blocks::build('blockname') ```.

### Translations

Translations can be stored in the database through the admin panel (/admin/translations).

You can call DB translation everywhere with ``` Lang::get('db.Key') ```, ``` trans('db.Key') ``` or ``` @lang('db.Key') ```.

### Sitemap

Route sitemap.xml generates a sitemap file in XML format.
To add modules to the site map configure app/config/sitemap.php.

### Settings

Change website title, and other options trough the settings panel. Settings are saved in the database.

### History

History table records changes and 25 latest records are displayed in the back officeâ€™s dashboard. Logged actions are *created*, *updated*, *deleted*, *set online* and *set offline*.
It works for all modules except users and groups.

## Facades

Modules that have their own Facade: News, Events, Projects, Places, Partners, Galleries, Blocks, Files and Menus.

In your views, you can call for example ```News::latest(3)``` to get the three latest news.
Check available methods in each module's repository.
